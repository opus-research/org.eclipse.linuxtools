GprofCompilerOptions_msg=No Gprof Data File Found
GprofCompileAgain_msg=Generated gmon.out file not found. Either this file has been generated in another directory (it may \
happen if your program runs chdir()), or your program has not been compiled with \"-pg\" option. \n\nBrowse for gmon.out location, \
or recompile at least one of your C/C++ source files with the \"-pg\" option.  If you link with \"-pg\" specified, you will \
get specially compiled versions of library functions. \nFor an Autotools project, the Autotools -> Configure Settings -> \
Advanced option page found in the Project Properties has a special option you can click to add gprof support.
GprofGmonStale_msg=Gprof Data File Out Of Date
GprofGmonStaleExplanation_msg=The gmon.out file is older than the executable being run.  It is likely that \
the file was generated previously and the executable just run was not composed of any objects compiled with the \"-pg\" option.
