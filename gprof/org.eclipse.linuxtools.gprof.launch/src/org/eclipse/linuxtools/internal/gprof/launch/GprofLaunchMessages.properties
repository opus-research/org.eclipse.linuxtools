GprofCompilerOptions_msg=No Gprof Data File Found
GprofCompileAgain_msg=There is no gmon.out file generated.  Recompile at least one of your C/C++ source files with the \"-pg\" \
option.  If you link with \"-pg\" specified, you will get specially compiled versions of library functions.
For an Autotools project, the Autotools -> Configure Settings -> Advanced option page found in the Project \
Properties has a special option you can click to add gprof support.
GprofGmonStale_msg=Gprof Data File Out Of Date
GprofGmonStaleExplanation_msg=The gmon.out file is older than the executable being run.  It is likely that \
the file was generated previously and the executable just run was not composed of any objects compiled with the \"-pg\" option.
