This directory contains the source code for the LTTng integration plugins for
Eclipse, which includes the generic Tracing and Monitoring Framework (TMF).

The plugins are categorized as follows:
org.eclipse.linuxtools.ctf.*          Common Trace Format (CTF) reader library
org.eclipse.linuxtools.gdbtrace.*     Support for reading and viewing GDB traces
org.eclipse.linuxtools.lttng2.*       LTTng 2.x integration
org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.*          Tracing and Monitoring Framework
org.eclipse.linuxtools.statesystem.*  State System library
org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.*  Code specific to the RCP version

See the plugins.svg file for a diagram showing the dependencies between the
different plugins.


To set up the environment to build TMF from within Eclipse, see this wiki page:
http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/LTTng_Eclipse_Plug-in_Development_Environment_Setup




To build the plugins manually using Maven, you first need to build the Linux Tools target definition
 (starting from the root of the source tree):
$ cd releng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.target
$ mvn clean install
Then you can build the LTTng plugins:
$ cd ../../lttng
$ mvn clean install

As long as you don't clear the Maven reactor cache (in ~/.m2), you should not
need to rebuild the target definition.


The default command will compile and run the unit tests. Running the tests can
take some time, to skip them you can append "-Dmaven.test.skip=true" to the
'mvn' command:
$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true


The RCP is not built by default, to build it you need to add "-PtracingRcp" to
the 'mvn' command:
$ mvn clean install -PtracingRcp -Dmaven.test.skip=true

This will build the RCP for all supported architectures. The resulting archives
will be placed in lttng/org.eclipse.linuxtools.tracing.rcp.product/target/products


To build a local p2 update site (LTTng integration only)
$ mvn clean install -PlttngPackage

This will place the p2 update site under the default location
/var/www/tools/linuxtools/lttng/update-nightly/

To change the package location, use:
$ mvn clean install -PlttngPackage "-DlttngPackageDestination=<package destination>"

where <package destination> is the absolute path to destination directory on your disk.
