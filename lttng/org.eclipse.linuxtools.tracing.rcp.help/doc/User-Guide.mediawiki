= Overview =
The Linux Tools Trace Viewer is a stand-alone application base on Eclipse's Rich Client Platform (RCP). The purpose of this is to have light-weight application to view analyze traces. It includes all TMF (Tracing and Monitoring Framework) features as well as all features of the LTTng (Linux Tracing Toolkit next generation) Eclipse integration that are provided by the Linux Tools Project     

= Getting Started =
To start the Linux Tools Trace Viewer, go to the directory where the Trace Viewer is installed and then run the application with name '''traceViewer'''. During startup the Trace Viewer creates, if necessary, a Eclipse workspace in the user's home directory with the name ''.traceviewer''. It also creates, if needed, a default tracing project with the name ''Tracing''. 

Now the application can be used as described in the User Guide for Linux Tools LTTng integration (see section [[#References | References]]).
