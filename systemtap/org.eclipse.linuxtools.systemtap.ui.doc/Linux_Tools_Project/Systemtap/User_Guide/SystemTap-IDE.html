		<h2 id="Getting_Started">Getting Started</h2>
		<h3 id="IDE_Tutorial">IDE Tutorial</h3>
		<h4 id="Lesson_1:_Getting_Started">Lesson 1: Getting Started</h4>
		<p>In this tutorial we will orient you with IDE Perspective and its functions. At this point we assume
			that you are able to run Systemtap plug-in and are unfamiliar with how to procede. If you cannot yet start
			the application, please refer to our 
			<a href="#Installation">Installation help page</a>

			<b>NOTE:</b> If this is the first time opening the IDE Perspective it will take a while to load as it has to 
			parse the tapsets.
		</p>
		<p>The IDE Perspective's purpose is to allow the user to create, view, and edit Systemtap scripts. There are
			other editors built in (plain text and the C editor), however, they ultimately exist to facilitate the 
			writing of Systemtap scripts.</p>
		<p>In this lesson we will open a new Systemtap script file to familiarize ourselves with the IDE Perspective.
			Start by opening the <u>F</u>ile menu and selecting <u>O</u>pen. A dialogue box will pop up and request the 
			location of the file you want to open. We've included a folder called "examples" right in the tar ball. You 
			may chose any of them to use; in this tutorial we will open top.stp. Go ahead and open the file.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Editor.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You'll see the file is loaded into the editor pane of Systemtap GUI. You'll also noticed different colored
			text. Systemtap GUI supports syntax highlighting for the ease of the writer. Feel free to edit the file.</p>
		<p>At this point proceed to 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script </a> if you wish to learn how to write your 
			own script file or 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script </a> if you wish to run this one.
		</p>
		<h4 id="Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script</h4>
		<p>In this tutorial we will guide you through the process of writing your first Systemtap script. It is strongly recommended that you review the 
			<b>Systemtap website's tutorial</b> - 
			<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/tutorial">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/tutorial</a> for up-to-date information on the latest version of Systemtap.  
		</p>
		<p>Start by selecting <u>F</u>ile-&gt;<u>N</u>ew. Specify a file name of your choosing, but be sure that it ends with an .stp extension. Click ok. Your blank script should be present in the editor pane. </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Newfile.png"/> 
		</p>
		<p>Now type/copy the following: </p>
		<pre> 
	global read, write, start

	probe begin {
		start = gettimeofday_s()
	}
	probe syscall.write {
		write += count
	}

	probe timer.ms(1000) {
		printf("%d\t%d\t%d\n", (gettimeofday_s()-start), read, write)
		read=0
		write=0
	}
</pre>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Now to demonstrate the functionality of the Probe Alias browser we will have you complete the read probe yourself. Start by opening the syscall folder in the Probe Alias browser. If you do not have any content in the browser you are experiencing a problem with Systemtap installation and should refer to our 
			<a href="#Installation">Installation help page</a>. Ensure your cursor is located at the end of the file. Now scroll down and double click the read probe alias. Systemtap GUI will insert the skeleton probe at the point at which your cursor is at, and should look similar to the following: 
		</p>
		<pre>probe syscall.read
{
	/*
	 * available variables on this probe:
	 * argstr, buf_uaddr, count, fd, name
	 */

}
</pre>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Now insert the following line into the syscall.read probe: </p>
		<pre>read += count
</pre>
		<p> 
			You may remove the comment (/* ... */) if you wish. </p>
		<p>This will count the number of bytes read and written each second and print it out. The begin probe executes first, by getting the time of day. The read and write probes increment each time the function is called. The timer probe prints the information every second. If you typed the script in manually you may have noticed that the editor provides code completion for probe alias. If you did not, type "syscall.". You'll see a box come up that you may use to select an item to complete your probe alias. </p>
		<p>In 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3</a> you will learn how to run Systemtap scripts in the IDE Perspective. 
		</p>
		<h4 id="Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script</h4>
		<p>In this lesson we will cover running your script. You may use either the example script you opened in Lesson 1 or the script you wrote in Lesson two. Select <u>R</u>un-&gt;<u>R</u>un. Enter the remote server details. You should receive output in the console similar to the following, which shows the reads and write per second.  </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/IDEOutput.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Now we will demonstrate running Systemtap scripts with graphs. In order to run the chart example you'll need to use the code provided in 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_2:_Writing_Your_First_Script">Lesson 2: Writing Your First Script </a>;. To do this select 
			<b><u>R</u>un-&gt;Run w/ <u>C</u>hart</b>. This feature will prompt the user for the number of columns for the chart, in addition to their titles and regular expressions. The regular expressions are used to parse the console output for the script and determine the values of each column at a certain sample point. The combined regular expression is shown at the bottom of the dialogue box. 
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Chartbox1.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>For this example enter the following: </p>
		<pre>	Columns: 3

	TITLE	REGULAR EXPRESSION	DELIMITER
	Time		\d+		.*			\D+
	Read		\d+		.*			\D+
	Write		\d+		.*			\D+

</pre>
		<p>The title fields simply display the associated string in the column's header. After clicking OK the script will prompt you for details regarding the Remote Server. Provide the ip address of the remote server that is running the systemtapgui Server or the Data Management Daemon. The port is by default 22462. Enter a username and password.This will give the application permissions to run your script on the remote machine. You have the option of saving your password as well, however be warned this is currently NOT encrypted so this convenience runs at a risk. The username is also used to transfer the file to the remote system using SCP. If the same machine is used as both the server and the client enter 'localhost' for the Host field. When the script is executed the application will switch into the Graphing perspective. A Data View chart is populated with live data, in addition to the output in the console.  You should see a screen similar to the following: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/IDEGraphics.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>You will see that the data table poplulates from live data parsed from the console. Now we'll make a graph to briefly illustrate the Graphing perspective. Click the Create Graph button next to bring up the Select Chart dialogue.Select line graph. You will be prompted to select a column of the X series and Y series; select "Time" and "Write" respectively. After you click ok you should see the line graph as follows: </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/IDEGraph.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>Note that the multiple series graphs (Multi-Line, Multi-Bar, and Multi-Scatter) will request two Y series, Y1 and Y2. In the case of our example, these would be "Read" and "Write". Each series will be assigned a different color value for the purposes of differentiation and will be plotted both in respect to the specified X series.</p>
		<p>Those are the basics behind running a script in Systemtap GUI. </p>
		<h2 id="Concepts">Concepts</h2>
		<h3 id="SystemTap_Perspectives">SystemTap Perspectives</h3>
		<p>SystemTap has three perspectives, each with its own purpose.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Ide.png"/> 
				<b>IDE Perspective</b> - This is the primary perspective for SystemTap script writers. It contains the 
				<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Function_Browser">Function Browser </a>, 
				<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Kernel_Browser">Kernel Browser </a>, 
				<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Probe_Alias_Browser">Probe Alias Browser </a>, and 
				<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Views_and_Editors">Views and Editors </a>. The IDE Perspective contains the features necessary execute SystemTap scripts and the syntax highlighting and code
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>completion features that facilitate efficient development of scripts.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Graphing.png"/> 
				<b>Graphing Perspective</b> - This perspective is invoked when the user calls the Run /w Chart option. It defaults to showing a data table containing the script results and is capable of producing six different chart types: Scatter Graph, Line Graph, Area Graph, Bar Graph, Pie Graph.
			</li>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Dash.png"/>
				<b>Dashboard Perspective</b> - This perspective is capable of storing meta-data related to each graph such as filters, aggregates, and display options in addition to showing a "dashboard" interface with multiple graphs updating simultaneously.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="STP_Editor">STP Editor</h3>
		<p>This editor is the most commonly used; it is used for the authoring and editing of Systemtap scripts. It is invoked when the user starts a new file or opens a file with the .stp extension. It provides syntax highlighting, code completion, and run support.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Editor.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>See also:

			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Toolbars">Toolbars </a>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Function_Browser">Function Browser</h3>
		<p>The Funtion Browser lists all of the functions that are defined in the tapset library.  Functions are grouped by the file that they are defined.  Each listed function has an icon that corresponds to its return type.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_str.gif"/> String
			</li>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_long.gif"/> Long
			</li>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_void.gif"/> Void
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you double click on any function a call to that function will be added to the active editor at the current cursor location.  Also if you right click on a function and click "View Definition" the tapset file where the function is defined will be opened.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Function.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The default behavior of this view is to look for functions in the tapset library in the local machine. To look for functions in the same machine used to run the SystemTap scripts, go to Window-&gt;Preferences, select SystemTap-&gt;SystemTap IDE and check the 
			<i>Use remote connection to load SystemTap probes and functions</i> option. Don't forget to configure the remote server used by remote execution in SystemTap-&gt;Remote Server.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Kernel_Browser">Kernel Browser</h3>
		<p>The Kernel Source Browser is used to display the kernel tree.  This provides you with a quick way to locate places to add probes.  Any file in the Kernel Source tree can be opened by double clicking on it.  This will open up the selected file in the Editor view.  You can then double click on the ruler next to any line that you wish to probe.  If SystemTap can probe that line a probe point will be inserted at the end of the script you were most recently working on.  If the line can't be probed, an error message will be displayed. </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/KernelSource.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>To use this feature it is necessary to configure the 
			<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Linux_Tools_Project/Systemtap/User_Guide#Kernel_Source_Location">Kernel Source Location</a>.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Probe_Alias_Browser">Probe Alias Browser</h3>
		<p>The Probe Alias Browser lists all of the probe aliases that are defined in the tapset library. Probes are grouped based on their type. In addition to the list of probes, each probe lists all of the variables that it has access to. Each variable is listed with an icon that represents its type. Types are as follows: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_str.gif"/> String 
			</li>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_long.gif"/> Long 
			</li>
			<li>
				<img border="0" src="images/Var_unk.gif"/> Unknown
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you double click on any probe alias, probe point will be added to the end of the active editor. Also if you right click on a probe and click "View Definition" the tapset file where the probe is defined will be opened. </p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/ProbeAlias.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The default behavior of this view is to look for probes in the local machine. To look for probes in the same machine used to run the SystemTap scripts, go to Window-&gt;Preferences, select SystemTap-&gt;SystemTap IDE and check the 
			<i>Use remote connection to load SystemTap probes and functions</i> option. Don't forget to configure the remote server used by remote execution in SystemTap-&gt;Remote Server.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Tasks">Tasks</h2>
		<h3 id="Creating_SystemTap_Scripts">Creating SystemTap Scripts</h3>
		<p>Create a SystemTap script by selecting 
			<b><u>F</u>ile-&gt;<u>N</u>ew</b> in the IDE Perspective. You'll be prompted to enter a name for the file; 
			<i>make sure that you use a .stp extension or else SystemTap GUI will not recognize the file as a SystemTap script and certain editor and run features will not be active.</i>
		</p>
		<p>Your new file will be open and ready for coding in the Editor pane.</p>
		<p>A 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#IDE_Tutorial">IDE Tutorial </a> is also provided in the help pages for a step by step demo.
		</p>
		<p>For advanced SystemTap langauge help please see the SystemTap Development User's Guide and the documentation available at the SystemTap website's documentation page -  
			<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html</a>
		</p>
		<h3 id="Using_the_STP_Editor">Using the STP Editor</h3>
		<p>The STP Editor is used for the authoring and editing of Systemtap scripts. It is invoked when the user starts a new file or opens a file with the .stp extension. Using the editor is as easy as setting the focus to the editor pane and typing.</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/Editor.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>There are certain features within the editor you may want to take advantage of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Syntax Highlighting - Certain code items are colored in .stp and .c files based on a set of rules and </li>
		</ul>
		<p>colors. You can turn this on or off and change the colors in 
			<b><u>W</u>indow-&gt;<u>P</u>references</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Code Assist - SystemTap GUI will attempt to finish your probe alias names based on what you have already</li>
		</ul>
		<p>typed. You can then select the appropriate probe alias or continue typing to filter the list down even more.
			You can turn this feature on and off or set the speed on it in 
			<b><u>W</u>indow-&gt;<u>P</u>references</b>.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Run Support - See the 
				<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script </a>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 id="Viewing_Data_Charts">Viewing Data Charts</h3>
		<p>Viewing data charts from a SystemTap script is accomplished by running that script with the 
			<b><u>R</u>un-&gt;<u>R</u>un w/ Chart</b> option. This is covered in the 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Lesson_3:_Running_Your_Script">Lesson 3: Running Your Script </a>. After running a script with the chart option, the user is taken into the Graphing Perspective and the Data Table is loaded by default. The data table immediately begins populating as it recieves input back through the console from the running SystemTap script.

		<h3 id="Frequently_Asked_Questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<p>This section details frequently asked questions relating to the IDE Perspective.</p>
		<p>
			<b>Where can I find information regarding the Systemtap scripting language?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: The best place to look for up to date information regarding Systemtap itself is its homepage - 
			<a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html">http://sourceware.org/systemtap/documentation.html</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>How do I run a script once I've written it?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: There are different options as far as running your Systemtap script. Please visit the 
			<a href="SystemTap-IDE.html#Menus">Menus </a> to learn more about the four ways of running Systemtap scripts.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b>Why does the application seem to hang when switching to the IDE Perspective?</b>
		</p>
		<p>A: If this is the first time you are trying to open the IDE perspective, or have recently gotten a new version of SystemTap this is expected.  In order to generate a full list of all of the available probes, and functions the GUI has to run the stap command.  If there are tapsets that do not run correctly using the 'stap -up2' comamnd this takes a long time.  In order to build as complete a list as possible it will use a binary filtering algorithm to figure out which tapset function is broken and generate data for all of the others.</p>
