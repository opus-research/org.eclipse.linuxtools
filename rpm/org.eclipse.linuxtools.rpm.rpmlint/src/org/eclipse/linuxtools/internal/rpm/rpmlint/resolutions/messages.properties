HardcodedPackagerTag_0=The Packager tag is hardcoded in your spec file. It should be removed, so as to use rebuilder's own defaults.
HardcodedPrefixTag_0=The Prefix tag is hardcoded in your spec file. It should be removed, so as to allow package relocation.
MacroInChangelog_0=Macros are expanded in %changelog too, which can in unfortunate cases lead 
MacroInChangelog_1=to the package not building at all, or other subtle unexpected conditions that\taffect the build.
NoBuildrootTag_0=The BuildRoot tag isn't used in your spec. It must be used in order to allow building the package as non root on some systems.
NoBuildSection_0=Insert empty %build section
NoCleaningOfBuildroot_0=You should clean $RPM_BUILD_ROOT in the %clean section and just after the beginning of %install section. Use "rm -Rf $RPM_BUILD_ROOT"
NoCleanSection_0=Insert empty %clean section
NoInstallSection_0=Insert empty %install section
NoPrepSection_0=Insert empty %prep section
PatchNotApplied_0=A patch is included in your package but was not applied. Refer to the patches documentation to see what's wrong.
RpmBuildrootUsage_0=$RPM_BUILD_ROOT should not be touched during %build or %prep stage, as it will break short circuiting.
SetupNotQuiet_0=Use the -q option to the %setup macro to avoid useless build output from unpacking the sources
